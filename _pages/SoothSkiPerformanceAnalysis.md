## 💡 Important Tips

- **Fully charge your phone** before recording to ensure you have enough battery for the entire ski session
- **Cell service is not necessary** – the app works completely offline and will save all sensor data locally
- **Upload on wifi** – recording files are large, so upload on a wifi connection when you're back at the lodge or home
- **Only works on iPhones** - more devices will be supported soon
